# 📚 Python Core Concepts — Learning Repository

Welcome to this learning-focused repository! 👋  
This repo includes well-organized notes and code snippets on core Python topics, all provided as PDF files. The goal is to build strong foundational understanding in Python programming with the help of clearly structured materials. ✨

Each topic has been explored and explained in a simple, beginner-friendly way, and can also serve as a reference for interviews, revisions, or general upskilling.

## 📂 Topics Covered

All topics below are documented with brief theory and hands-on Python code examples. Each topic is saved as an individual PDF file inside the repository.

### ⚙️ Just-In-Time Compilation (JIT)

An advanced optimization technique that compiles code at runtime rather than before execution. It helps improve the performance of interpreted languages like Python (via PyPy).

### 🧱 Tuple vs List

Tuples and lists are both sequence types, but differ in mutability and performance. This topic explores when and why to use one over the other.

### ⏱️ Time Complexity

Time complexity describes how efficiently an algorithm performs as input size increases. This topic introduces Big O notation and analyzes Python operations.

### 🧠 Object Work Behind Functions

Functions in Python are objects too! This topic explains how functions are treated internally, how closures work, and how objects are passed to functions.

### ✅ Pytest

A powerful testing tool for Python. Learn how to write, structure, and run tests using `pytest` with minimal setup and maximum readability.

### 🛑 Exception Handling

Learn how Python handles errors using try-except blocks. Includes best practices, use of finally, and custom exception creation for robust applications.
